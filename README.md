# Air Quality Report using Power BI

This project presents an interactive Air Quality analysis and visualization dashboard created using Power BI. It leverages the **city_day.xlsx** dataset which contains daily air quality index data across major Indian cities, sourced from the Central Pollution Control Board.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize the Air Quality Index (AQI) and pollutant trends over time across various Indian cities. Using Power BI, the report delivers insights on:

- City-wise AQI trends
- Pollutant-wise levels (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, CO, SO₂, O₃)
- Time-series changes
- Comparative analysis of cities/states
- Monthly and yearly pollution patterns
- Key observations and summary KPIs

## 🗂️ Dataset Used

- **File:** `city_day.xlsx`
- **Source:** Central Pollution Control Board
- **Attributes include:**
  - Date
  - City
  - State
  - Pollutant values (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, CO, SO₂, O₃)
  - AQI and AQI bucket (categorical air quality category)

## 📁 Files Included

| File Name         | Description                            |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `city_day.xlsx`   | Dataset of daily air quality values    |
| `pds-1.pbit`      | Power BI template/dashboard report     |

## 💡 Key Insights Visualized

- Top 10 most and least polluted cities
- Seasonal variation of pollutants
- AQI classification distribution (Good, Moderate, Poor, etc.)
- City/state-wise pollution comparison
- Monthly pollutant averages

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboarding
- **Excel**: Dataset in `.xlsx` format
- **DAX/Power Query**: Data transformation and calculations

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Download** the `city_day.xlsx` and `pds-1.pbit` files.
2. **Open Power BI Desktop**.
3. **Open the `.pbit` file**. When prompted, select the `city_day.xlsx` file as the data source.
4. Power BI will automatically load the data and render the dashboard.

## 📌 Note

Ensure the dataset file path is correctly linked in Power BI when prompted during template load.
